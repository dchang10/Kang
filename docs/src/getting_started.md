# What is Krang.jl?

Kerr Raytracer for Analytic Null Geodesics (Krang) is a raytracing code for geometries that are embedded in the Kerr spacetime.
Krang solves the Kerr geodesic problem using the analytic solutions that have been derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi Formalism.
This choice makes the code efficient and accurate, and is an ideal formalism to isolated sub images that manifest from strong lensing.

## Philosophy
The current philosophy of Krang is to raytrace meshes.
Meshes are made by 'painting' materials onto geometries.
These are then viewed by cameras that are sensitive to particular observables (*e.g. intensity and polarization*).

## Raytracing

Light rays in this module can be parameterized in terms of either the cones ($\theta_s$), or the minotime ($\Delta\tau$).
Parameterization interms of cones allows for images to separated interms of sub images and ray traced individually.

### Raytracing conical surfaces
Surfaces of constant $\theta$ define spin axis centered cones whose apex lie at the origin of the coordinate system.
